## Understanding the Network

### Network Structure
- **Input Layer**: 2 neurons (for 2D features)
- **Hidden Layer**: Configurable (2-10 neurons)
- **Output Layer**: 1 neuron (binary classification)
- **Activation Function**: Sigmoid

### Learning Process
1. **Forward Pass**: Input flows through the network to produce an output
2. **Loss Calculation**: Compare output with true label using Mean Squared Error
3. **Backward Pass**: Calculate gradients using backpropagation
4. **Weight Update**: Adjust weights using gradient descent

### Key Concepts Demonstrated
- **Activation Functions**: How sigmoid transforms linear combinations
- **Gradient Descent**: How weights are updated to minimize loss
- **Backpropagation**: How errors propagate backward through the network
- **Decision Boundaries**: How the network learns to separate classes
- **Non-linear Classification**: How hidden layers enable complex decision boundaries

## Educational Value

This application is perfect for:
- Students learning about neural networks
- Educators teaching machine learning concepts
- Anyone curious about how neural networks work internally
- Visualizing the mathematics behind deep learning

## Tips for Learning

1. Start with the **Linear** dataset to see how the network solves simple problems
2. Move to **XOR** to understand why hidden layers are necessary
3. Try **Circle** to see complex non-linear decision boundaries
4. Experiment with different numbers of hidden neurons
5. Adjust the learning rate to see its effect on training speed and stability
6. Use single-step training to observe individual weight updates
